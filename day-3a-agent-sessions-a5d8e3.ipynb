Drug discovery is one of the areas where AI is having a profound and rapidly accelerating impact. Here are some of the key new developments and trends:\n\n**1. Deeper Integration of Generative AI:**\n\n*   **Novel Molecule Design:** Generative AI models (like those based on transformers or diffusion models) are moving beyond simply identifying existing drug candidates. They are now actively *designing entirely new molecules* with desired properties, such as binding affinity to a specific target, improved ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, Toxicity) profiles, and even novel mechanisms of action.\n*   **\"In Silico\" Experimentation:** These models can simulate how potential drug molecules will interact with biological targets, drastically reducing the need for expensive and time-consuming wet-lab experiments in the early stages.\n\n**2.

Data-Driven Approaches:**\n\n*   **Real-World Evidence (RWE) Integration:** AI is key to analyzing RWE from electronic health records, insurance claims, and other sources to understand drug effectiveness and safety in real-world patient populations, complementing traditional clinical trial data.\n*   **Knowledge Graphs:** AI-powered knowledge graphs are being built to represent complex biological relationships, helping researchers navigate and discover new insights from massive amounts of scientific literature and data.\n\n**Examples of Progress:**\n\n*   **Insilico Medicine:** This company has been at the forefront, using AI to discover and advance novel drug candidates. They have achieved significant milestones in bringing AI-discovered drugs from concept to clinical trials at an unprecedented pace.\n*   **Recursion Pharmaceuticals:** They use AI and machine learning to map human cellular responses to discover new treatments for genetic diseases.\n*   **Exscientia:** Another pioneer in AI-driven drug discovery, they have multiple AI-designed molecules in clinical trials.\n\n**Challenges and Future Outlook:**\n\nDespite these advances, challenges remain, including:\n\n*   **Data Quality and Access:** The success of AI heavily relies on high-quality, diverse, and accessible datasets.\n*   **Validation:** Rigorous experimental validation is still essential to confirm AI-generated hypotheses.\n*   **Regulatory Acceptance:** While increasing, regulatory bodies are still adapting to the nuances of AI-driven drug development.\n*   **Interpretability:** Understanding *why* an AI model makes a particular prediction or design choice is crucial for scientific trust and progress.\n\nHowever, the trajectory is clear: AI is no longer just a tool in drug discovery; it's becoming an indispensable partner, fundamentally reshaping how we find and develop new medicines. We can expect to see more AI-discovered drugs entering clinical trials and eventually reaching patients in the coming years.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the **\"AI for Target Identification and Validation\"** development in drug discovery. Let's dive deeper into that:\n\n**The Problem:**\n\nHistorically, identifying a good **drug target** (a specific molecule, usually a protein or gene, that a drug can interact with to treat a disease) has been a major bottleneck in drug discovery. It's often a slow, expensive, and sometimes lucky process. Researchers might spend years investigating a disease pathway to pinpoint a key player that, if modulated, could alleviate the symptoms or even cure the disease.\n\n**How AI is Revolutionizing This:**\n\nAI, particularly machine learning, excels at finding patterns and making predictions from vast, complex datasets. In target identification and validation, AI leverages this capability in several ways:\n\n1.  **Analyzing Multi-Omics Data:**\n    *   **What it is:** Diseases aren't caused by a single factor. They involve intricate interactions at the genetic (genomics), protein (proteomics), RNA (transcriptomics), and metabolic (metabolomics) levels. AI can simultaneously analyze these \"omics\" datasets from healthy and diseased individuals.\n    *   **How AI helps:** AI algorithms can identify genes, proteins, or pathways that are consistently altered in diseased states compared to healthy ones. This allows researchers to spot potential targets that are malfunctioning or over/under-expressed, suggesting they are critical to the disease process.\n    *   **Example:** An AI might analyze the genomic data of cancer patients and discover a specific gene mutation that is prevalent in a particular aggressive form of cancer. It might then cross-reference this with proteomic data to see if that gene's protein product is also unusually active, thus flagging it as a potential target.\n\n2.  **Mining Scientific Literature and Databases:**\n    *   **What it is:** The sheer volume of published scientific research is overwhelming. AI can process millions of research papers, patents, and clinical trial databases far faster than any human.\n    *   **How AI helps:** Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques can extract relationships between genes, proteins, diseases, and drugs from text. AI can build \"knowledge graphs\" that visually represent these relationships, highlighting connections that might be missed by manual review. This can reveal previously overlooked targets or suggest new hypotheses.\n    *   **Example:** An AI might scour thousands of papers on Alzheimer's disease and identify recurring mentions of a specific protein, even if it wasn't the primary focus of any single study. By analyzing the context, it might suggest this protein plays a more critical role in disease progression than previously thought.\n\n3.  **Predicting \"Druggability\":**\n    *   **What it is:** Not all targets are \"druggable.\" A target needs to be accessible to a drug molecule, have a binding site that can be modulated, and its modulation should ideally lead to a therapeutic effect without causing unacceptable side effects.\n    *   **How AI helps:** AI models can be trained on data from known successful and unsuccessful drug targets. They learn to predict the \"druggability\" of a newly identified target based on its structural properties, its role in biological networks, and its similarity to previously characterized targets. This helps prioritize which potential targets are most likely to yield a successful drug.\n    *   **Example:** If an AI identifies a new protein involved in inflammation, it can analyze the protein's 3D structure (if known) and its interaction patterns to predict if it has a pocket suitable for a small molecule drug to bind to.\n\n4.  **Understanding Disease Mechanisms:**\n    *   **What it is:** Diseases are complex systems. AI can help unravel these complexities.\n    *   **How AI helps:** By analyzing complex biological networks and pathways, AI can help researchers understand the intricate cause-and-effect relationships that lead to disease. Identifying the most upstream or critical nodes in these networks often leads to the most effective drug targets.\n    *   **Example:** For a complex autoimmune disease, AI might model how various immune cells and signaling molecules interact. It could pinpoint a specific receptor on a T-cell that, when blocked, would dampen the overall inflammatory response more effectively than targeting downstream effects.\n\n**Benefits:**\n\n*   **Speed:** AI dramatically accelerates the process of identifying and validating potential drug targets.\n*   **Cost Reduction:** By focusing resources on more promising targets and reducing the number of failed experiments, AI helps lower the immense cost of drug discovery.\n*   **Novelty:** AI can uncover targets and disease mechanisms that human researchers might not have considered due to data overload or conventional thinking.\n*   **Increased Success Rates:** By prioritizing \"druggable\" and validated targets, AI can contribute to higher success rates in subsequent drug development phases.\n\nIn essence, AI acts like a highly intelligent, tireless researcher that can sift through mountains of data to highlight the most promising molecular players in a disease, and then provide evidence to support why they would make good targets for new medicines.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  The landscape of companies involved in AI for drug discovery, including target identification and validation, is diverse and rapidly evolving.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
